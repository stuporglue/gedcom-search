GEDCOM-Search
=============

PHP search engine for searching GEDCOM files with customizable results weighting


Work in progress (July 18, 2013)
--------------------------------
This will be a class for searching a GEDCOM file. It will prioritize results so 
that individuals are listed higher than families (for example). 

The prioritization algorithm will be customizable.

It is using https://github.com/mrkrstphr/php-gedcom to parse the GEDCOM file.
